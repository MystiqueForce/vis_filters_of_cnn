Use a Convolutional Neural Network - the popular VGG16 model, and visualizing various filters from different layers of the CNN.
This is done by using gradient ascent to visualize images that maximally activate specific filters from different layers of the model.

Using TensorFlow as our machine learning framework. The project uses the Google Colab environment.
